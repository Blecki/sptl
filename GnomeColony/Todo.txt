Surface blocks - aka water. Only drawn when the block above it is not the same type.
World generation.
	- Much larger world. Like super sized.
	* - Super zoomed out view
	- Generate 'block types', not specific blocks - then fill in with blocks.
Fix movement

Main menu - 
	Simple gui buttons
	Gui elements in tile texture?
	Unique tileset for gui assets?

Render tree has lighting info - can't keep lights hardcoded in game.

== COMPLETED ==
* Run AI on constant tick rate
	- The entire simulation now runs on a constant tick rate.
	- This has horribly broken gnome motion.
* Refactor block tiles stuff in sim into a 'block set' type
	* - Needs to be a pervasive change to all things that use the block set.
* Need to find blocks by name, not using an enum.
* Block definition language
* "Fringe" blocks - hang below existing block, things like hanging vines, bottom of ramps, etc.
* "Actor Actions" should not require access to the sim. How to reconcile this with the move action, which needs to follow the grid? 
	- Move action takes a set of points to move along and a time frame to do it in. It does NOT know about the grid.
	- 'Tick Time' - [0, 1] - time elapsed in current tick
* Block definition loader needs to do a better job reporting errors.
* Clean up thing where tasks are passed gnomes, and have an assigned gnome.
* 'Decal' objects - AKA, train tracks. Applied on surface of block.
* Blocks can be buildable or not
